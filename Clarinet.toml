# trusted_sender: if true, inputs are trusted after tx_sender has been checked.
# trusted_caller: if true, inputs are trusted after contract-caller has been checked.
# callee_filter: if true, untrusted data may be passed into a private function without a
# warning, if it gets checked inside. This check will also propagate up to the
# caller.
