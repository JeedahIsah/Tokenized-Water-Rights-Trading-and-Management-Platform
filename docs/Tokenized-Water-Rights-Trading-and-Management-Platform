# PRD: Tokenized Water Rights Trading and Management Platform

## Overview
The **Tokenized Water Rights Trading and Management Platform** is a blockchain-based system that digitizes water rights as tokens, enabling transparent allocation, trading, and usage tracking. The system ensures:
- Secure issuance and management of water rights.
- Transparent secondary market for water rights trading.
- Usage accountability and compliance with regulations.
- Community governance over resource allocation and dispute resolution.

Each smart contract is modular, focusing on a specific domain without interdependencies.

---

## Objectives
1. Tokenize water rights as digital assets that represent usage entitlements.
2. Enable secure and transparent peer-to-peer trading of rights.
3. Track usage of water rights and enforce compliance.
4. Support regulators and communities in overseeing water resource management.
5. Provide incentives for conservation and responsible usage.

---

## Stakeholders
- **Water Rights Holders**: Individuals or organizations allocated water rights.
- **Buyers/Traders**: Entities interested in purchasing additional rights.
- **Regulators**: Government agencies overseeing water allocation and enforcement.
- **Community DAO**: Collective governance body for rule-making and dispute resolution.
- **Auditors**: Independent bodies verifying fair allocation and compliance.

## Core Modules (Smart Contracts)

### 1. **WaterRightsRegistry Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Maintain an on-chain record of water rights issued by regulators.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map rights { rightId: { owner: principal, volume: uint, validFrom: uint, validUntil: uint, region: string, active: bool } }`
- `event WaterRightIssued(rightId, owner, volume, region, validity)`

**Justification:**  
Establishes the foundation by registering legitimate, regulator-approved water rights in a tamper-proof ledger.

---

### 2. **WaterRightsToken Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Represent water rights as fungible tokens (SIP-010 compliant), allowing transfer, trading, and fractional ownership.

**Data Structures:**  
- Standard token mappings: `balances`, `allowances`, `totalSupply`
- `event Transfer(from, to, amount)`
- `event Mint(to, amount)`

**Justification:**  
Tokenization enables efficient transferability, market liquidity, and partial ownership of water rights.

---

### 3. **Marketplace Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Facilitate peer-to-peer trading of tokenized water rights with transparent pricing.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map listings { listingId: { seller: principal, token: principal, amount: uint, price: uint, active: bool } }`
- `event ListingCreated(listingId, seller, amount, price)`
- `event ListingExecuted(listingId, buyer, amount)`

**Justification:**  
Provides a transparent and regulated marketplace for participants to buy and sell rights without intermediaries.

---

### 4. **UsageReporting Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Allow right holders to report actual water usage, with validators confirming accuracy.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map usageReports { reportId: { rightId: uint, reportedBy: principal, volumeUsed: uint, timestamp: uint, verified: bool } }`
- `map verifications { reportId: { validator: principal, approved: bool } }`
- `event UsageReported(reportId, rightId, volumeUsed)`
- `event UsageVerified(reportId, validator, status)`

**Justification:**  
Links tokenized rights to real-world usage and ensures accountability, preventing over-extraction.

---

### 5. **ComplianceContract**
**Purpose:**  
Enforce penalties or revoke rights if holders exceed usage or violate regulations.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map complianceRecords { rightId: { compliant: bool, violations: uint, penalties: uint } }`
- `event ViolationRecorded(rightId, penalty)`
- `event RightRevoked(rightId)`

**Justification:**  
Encourages responsible usage and provides a deterrent for overuse or misuse of water rights.

---

### 6. **GovernanceDAO Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Enable stakeholders (regulators, communities, rights holders) to vote on policies, rule changes, and dispute resolution.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map proposals { proposalId: { title: string, description: string, votesFor: uint, votesAgainst: uint, deadline: uint, executed: bool } }`
- `map votes { proposalId: { voter: principal, choice: bool } }`
- `event ProposalCreated(proposalId, title)`
- `event VoteCast(proposalId, voter, choice)`

**Justification:**  
Decentralizes policy-making and ensures fair community participation in resource management.

---

### 7. **ReputationNFT Contract**
**Purpose:**  
Mint non-transferable NFTs (soulbound tokens) to participants with good compliance history or conservation contributions.

**Data Structures:**  
- `map reputationNFTs { holder: principal, metadata: string, issuedBy: principal }`
- `event ReputationNFTIssued(holder, metadata)`

**Justification:**  
Encourages positive behavior by recognizing compliant and conservation-oriented participants, fostering trust in the system.

---

## System Workflow

1. **Right Issuance**  
   Regulators issue water rights in `WaterRightsRegistry`.
2. **Tokenization**  
   Water rights are represented as tradable tokens in `WaterRightsToken`.
3. **Marketplace Trading**  
   Holders list and trade tokens via the `Marketplace`.
4. **Usage Reporting**  
   Rights holders report consumption in `UsageReporting`; validators verify accuracy.
5. **Compliance Enforcement**  
   Violations are tracked in `ComplianceContract`, leading to penalties or revocation.
6. **Governance Participation**  
   Stakeholders propose and vote on governance matters in `GovernanceDAO`.
7. **Reputation Recognition**  
   Compliant and responsible users receive `ReputationNFTs`.

---

## Technical Requirements
- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Clarity smart contracts) leveraging Bitcoin security.
- **Token Standards**: SIP-010 for fungible tokens, SIP-009 for NFTs.
- **Wallet Integration**: Hiro Wallet for participation.
- **Off-Chain Oracles**: For integrating real-world water usage data.
- **Event Logging**: Full auditability via contract events.

---

## Justification for Modular Design
- **WaterRightsRegistry**: Maintains legitimacy of issued rights.  
- **WaterRightsToken**: Creates a liquid digital asset for rights.  
- **Marketplace**: Ensures transparent trading.  
- **UsageReporting**: Links on-chain rights to real-world usage.  
- **ComplianceContract**: Enforces rules and penalizes misuse.  
- **GovernanceDAO**: Decentralizes decision-making.  
- **ReputationNFT**: Incentivizes compliance and conservation.  

---

## Success Metrics
- Number of water rights issued and tokenized.
- Marketplace trading volume and liquidity.
- Reported vs. verified water usage accuracy.
- Compliance rate and reduction in violations.
- Active participation in governance proposals.
- ReputationNFTs issued for conservation and compliance.
