# Tokenized Water Rights Trading and Management Platform

## Overview

The Tokenized Water Rights Trading and Management Platform is a blockchain-based system that digitizes water rights as tokens, enabling transparent allocation, trading, and usage tracking. Built on the Stacks blockchain, this platform ensures:

- Secure issuance and management of water rights
- Transparent secondary market for water rights trading
- Usage accountability and compliance with regulations
- Community governance over resource allocation and dispute resolution

Each smart contract is modular, focusing on a specific domain without interdependencies.

## Core Modules

### 1. WaterRightsRegistry Contract
Maintains an on-chain record of water rights issued by regulators.

### 2. WaterRightsToken Contract
Represents water rights as fungible tokens (SIP-010 compliant), allowing transfer, trading, and fractional ownership.

### 3. Marketplace Contract
Facilitates peer-to-peer trading of tokenized water rights with transparent pricing.

### 4. UsageReporting Contract
Allows right holders to report actual water usage, with validators confirming accuracy.

### 5. ComplianceContract
Enforces penalties or revokes rights if holders exceed usage or violate regulations.

### 6. GovernanceDAO Contract
Enables stakeholders to vote on policies, rule changes, and dispute resolution.

### 7. ReputationNFT Contract
Mints non-transferable NFTs (soulbound tokens) to participants with good compliance history or conservation contributions.

## System Workflow

1. **Right Issuance** - Regulators issue water rights in `WaterRightsRegistry`
2. **Tokenization** - Water rights are represented as tradable tokens in `WaterRightsToken`
3. **Marketplace Trading** - Holders list and trade tokens via the `Marketplace`
4. **Usage Reporting** - Rights holders report consumption in `UsageReporting`; validators verify accuracy
5. **Compliance Enforcement** - Violations are tracked in `ComplianceContract`, leading to penalties or revocation
6. **Governance Participation** - Stakeholders propose and vote on governance matters in `GovernanceDAO`
7. **Reputation Recognition** - Compliant and responsible users receive `ReputationNFTs`

## Technical Requirements

- **Blockchain**: Stacks (Clarity smart contracts) leveraging Bitcoin security
- **Token Standards**: SIP-010 for fungible tokens, SIP-009 for NFTs
- **Development Tools**: Clarinet SDK for local development and testing
- **Wallet Integration**: Hiro Wallet for participation
- **Event Logging**: Full auditability via contract events

## Development Setup

1. Install [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet)
2. Clone this repository
3. Run tests with `clarinet test` (once contracts are implemented)

## Development Guidelines

This project follows best practices for Clarity smart contract development:

- **Architecture Patterns**: Modular contract design with separation of concerns
- **Best Practices**: Consistent naming, error handling, and documentation
- **Language Rules**: Strict adherence to Clarity language specifications
- **Security Rules**: Implementation of access controls, validation, and circuit breakers
- **Testing & Deployment**: Comprehensive testing strategies and deployment procedures
